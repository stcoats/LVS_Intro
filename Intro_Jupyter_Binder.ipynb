        "According to the [Jupyter help documentation](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/What%20is%20the%20Jupyter%20Notebook.html), the Jupyter Notebook is an interactive computing environment that enables users to author notebook documents that include: - Live code - Interactive widgets - Plots - Narrative text - Equations - Images - Video.\n",
        "\n",
        "Notebook documents contain the inputs and outputs of an interactive session as well as narrative text that accompanies the code but is not meant for execution. Rich output generated by running code, including HTML, images, video, and plots, is embedded in the notebook, which makes it a complete and self-contained record of a computation.\n",

        "\n",
        "A `kernel` is a program that runs code in Jupyter Notebooks. For each notebook document that a user opens, the application starts a kernel that runs the code for that notebook. This particular Jupyter Notebook is running an `R` kernel, which allows us to write and execute R code.\n",

        "A number of other kernels are available for Jupyter Notebooks, including `Python`, `C++`, `SQL`, and [many more](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels). You can try some of these without installing Anaconda by visiting the [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/try) website.

A cell is a text input field, and its contents can be executed by using `Shift-Enter`, or by clicking either the “Play” button the toolbar, or Cell, Run in the menu bar. The execution behavior of a cell is determined by the cell’s type. There are three types of cells: code cells, markdown cells, and raw cells. Every cell starts off being a code cell, but its type can be changed by using a drop-down on the toolbar (which will be “Code”, initially), or via keyboard shortcuts.\n",

Then at a later point in time you can overwrite the notebook with the one from the browser storage. Before you go on breaks, or at the end of the day's session, click the cloud with the down arrow.
